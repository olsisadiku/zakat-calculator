          Principles of Islamic Financial Ethics
        </h2>
      </div>

      <p class="drop-cap text-lg leading-relaxed text-ink-light mb-8">
        Before understanding Zakat, it is important to understand the Islamic
        perspective on wealth itself. Islam does not condemn wealth, nor does it
        glorify poverty. Instead, it frames wealth as a trust from God — a tool
        to be used responsibly, shared generously, and never hoarded.
      </p>

      <!-- Is it wrong to be rich? -->
      <div class="card mb-6">
        <h3 class="text-2xl mb-3">Is It Wrong to Be Rich?</h3>
        <p class="text-ink-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
          No. Being wealthy is not sinful in Islam. Many of the Prophet's
          companions were wealthy, and their wealth was a means of serving
          their communities. What is sinful is failing to care for those in
          need, hoarding wealth, or allowing money to corrupt one's character.
        </p>
        <p class="text-ink-light leading-relaxed">
          The question is not <em>how much</em> you have, but <em>what you do</em>
          with it and whether it controls you or you control it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Is poverty a virtue? -->
      <div class="card mb-6">
        <h3 class="text-2xl mb-3">Is Poverty a Virtue?</h3>
        <p class="text-ink-light leading-relaxed">
          No. Islam does not elevate poverty as a spiritual ideal. Rather, it
          encourages seeking a balance — much like food. Eating too little
          harms the body; eating too much harms it as well. Wealth, like
          sustenance, is best in moderation — enough to provide for yourself,
          your dependents, and your community.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- This is a test -->
      <div class="pull-quote">
        "Wealth is a test — a trust (amānah) from God. How you earn, manage,
        and distribute it is part of life's stewardship."
      </div>

      <div class="card mb-6">
        <h3 class="text-2xl mb-3">What is Real Wealth?</h3>
        <p class="text-ink-light leading-relaxed">
          The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught that real wealth is
          not abundance of possessions, but wealth of the heart and soul —
          contentment (<em>qanā'ah</em>). A person who is content with what
          God has given them is richer than the person who possesses everything
          but always craves more.

        Before diving into calculations, you need to understand the core

        are essential to accurately understanding your obligations.

            General charitable giving, which includes Zakat. Sadaqa is a broader

            The silver standard is more commonly used because it sets a lower
            threshold, ensuring more people fulfill this obligation.

              The rate is <strong>2.5%</strong> on all qualifying wealth. It is
              not progressive like income tax — whether you have $10,000 or
              $10,000,000 above Nisab, you pay the same percentage.

              The act of paying Zakat spiritually cleanses your remaining wealth.
              It removes greed, attachment, and any impurity from how the wealth

              Zakat applies only to wealth you can actually use and benefit from.
              Personal-use items (your home, car, furniture, clothing) are not
              subject to Zakat. Only surplus, productive, or tradeable wealth
